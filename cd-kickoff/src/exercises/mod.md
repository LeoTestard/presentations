# Connected Devices Kickoff 2016 Exercises

This is just a mod file for all the separate documents for each set of
exercises (which correspond to sub-directories), as well as a central
index, based on markdown file(s) in this directory.

During the presentation, we will pause at various points and let the
audience work on the appropriate exercise set.

```rust
mod hello { mod hello; }

#[cfg(wont_build_by_design)]
mod ownership { mod ownership; }

mod borrowing { mod borrowing; }
mod structs { mod structs; }
mod threads { mod threads; }
mod closures { mod closures; }
```
