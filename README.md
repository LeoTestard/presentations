pnkfelix/presentations
======================

Source for various presentations by Felix Klock (@pnkfelix).

The index is hosted, at least in principle, at:
http://pnkfelix.github.io/presentations/

Various branches hold source documents for building specific
presentations, but the rendered products are in theory meant to be
held here, in the `gh-pages` branch of this repository.

If you have having problems building (via (`cargo build`) out of the box (especially on the `qcon-london-2016` branch), try looking at the following:
