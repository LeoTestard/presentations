 ;; TODO: Overview of what Rust offers (one slide), then transition to the "Why"

;; Lindsey Kuper haiku:
;; a systems language
;; pursuing the trifecta
;; safe, concurrent, fast

;; Rust: dherman "Love-child of C++ Erlang and O'Caml/Haskell"
;; My preferred: C++ grew up, went to university, and was a roommate of Erlang and ML/Haskell/...

;; Stack allocation, data ownership, monomorphisation and inlining
;; Actors, message-passing, failure
;; (Goal of) type safety, pattern matching + destructuring, type clases, no null

;; High-level features of Rust of interest:
;; - type inference
;; - safe task-based concurrency
;; - higher-order functions
;; - pattern matching and algebraic data types
;; - polymorphism

;; A Web Browser is a multi-tasking operating system (e.g. page/tab is a task!)
