## Why use Rust? { .big_text data-transition="fade-out" }

> - Fast code, low memory footprint

  <div class="fragment">... to high-level (collections, closures, generic containers) ...</div>
  <div class="fragment">with *zero cost* (no GC, unboxed closures, monomorphization of generics)</div>
> - *Safety* and *Parallelism*

## Safety and Parallelism {.center}

### Safety

* No segmentation faults

* No undefined behavior

* No data races

### (Multi-paradigm) Parallelism

  * msg passing via channels

  * shared state via `Arc` and atomics, `Mutex`, etc

  * use native threads... or scoped threads... or work-stealing...

## Why would Mozilla sponsor Rust?   { data-transition="fade" }

>- Hard to prototype research-y browser changes atop C++ code base

>- Rust â‡’ Servo, WebRender

>- Want Rust for next-gen infrastructure (services, IoT)

>- > "Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent."

>- "accessible to all"

## Where is Rust now?
